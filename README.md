# Getting Started with this sample todo app

This sample todo app is created using using typescript & react js(Context API & Reducer).

To run this project locally, navigate to your project directory  & simply follow the steps below

1. `git clone https://github.com/SUPERTEMPO/react-typescript-context-usereducer.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Assumming it's running on port 3000

## How it works

In this project i have implemented react context api and reducer using typescript. You could be stuck searching online on to how to implement ***react context api*** with ***useReducer*** in typescript properly as most of the tutorials out here are not explicitly done using a clear approach. But in this project, i have properly configured ***context api with useReducer*** ensuring it's type safety and followed the best principles possible.

Also, within this project you will learn how to structure your app to make it maintainable and easier to manage as the business logic is separated from the UI logic making your code reusable. 


**That's it. You're done**
